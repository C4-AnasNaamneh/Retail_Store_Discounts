We add an array of objects of users details include total bill then when we get the users
using getAllUsers method it will calculate the net amount after discount and the amount of 
discount is determined depending on user type whether he is an employee (he will get 0.3 discount) or
customer (he will get 0.1 discount)

Also we can get a specific user using getUserById method
